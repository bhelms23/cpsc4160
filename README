First Attempt at a simple Pong Game using the MVC method.

Python Version: 3.9.7
OS: MacOS 13.2.1

The Motivation behind this iteration of Pong was to follow the MVC methodology because it was assigned to us but also because it helps consolodate the
allowing for it to be used as a template for future projects. In this specific version of Pong it is a multiplayer game where the first person to 5 wins.
Another thing that I added that is a little different, is that when the ball hits the top or bottom of the board it makes it speed up so that the player
gains an advantage by hitting it off of the top. 

Future Updates:
  Add a main menu that allows for selection between one player or two
  Add a difficulty selector to let the user select how fast the ball moves
  Add a customization for the paddle colors and ball colors
  Add a customization for what the end score could be
  Add PowerUps (Slow Mo, x2 Score, multiple balls, etc)
  
  Future Game Adaptability:
    With most of the functionality being generalized, the only thing we would need to change to completely adjust what game we are playing is change
    some of the entities to show other shapes or sprites, another thing is just to change the game rules. With the MVC methods being already implemented
    it requires small changes to alter the game.
